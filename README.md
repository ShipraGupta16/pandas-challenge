# Module 4 Challenge

This challenge is about analyzing school and district-wide standardized test data. Data provided has every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Our task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance and summarize the analysis.

## PyCity Schools Analysis

1) Charter schools have demonstrated remarkable academic success with a high overall passing percentage of over 90%, surpassing district schools. This achievement is particularly notable considering that charter schools operate with comparatively lower total school budgets. In contrast, district schools have struggled to achieve a passing percentage of over 55%, despite their higher total school budgets.<br></br>
The top five highest performing schools in terms of overall passing percentage are exclusively charter schools, showcasing their effectiveness in delivering quality education. These schools have consistently shown exceptional performance, reflecting the positive impact of the charter school model on student success. <br></br>


2) Smaller and medium-sized schools, specifically those with less than 1000 or 1000-2000 students, have demonstrated exceptional academic performance with an impressive overall passing percentage of approximately 90%. Notably, these schools are predominantly charter-based institutions that prioritize personalized attention and individualized instruction for their students. In contrast, larger schools with student populations ranging from 2000 to 5000 have faced challenges in achieving academic success, as evidenced by their comparatively lower overall passing percentage of 58%. It is also important to consider the potential implications of managing larger student populations.<br></br>
These findings emphasize the potential benefits of smaller school sizes and the advantages of the charter school model in providing quality education. The focus on individualized instruction and close student-teacher interactions in smaller and medium-sized charter schools has proven instrumental in fostering high levels of academic success. <br></br>
